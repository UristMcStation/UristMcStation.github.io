      <p align="justify">Urist McStation is a Medium Roleplay (MRP) Space Station 13 server running a heavily modified Baystation 12 code branch. Urist started in February 2013 by a group of people from the Bay 12 (Dwarf Fortress) forums who were tired of the overly oppressive rules of Baystation, and the overly lax attitude towards roleplay of /tg/station and Goon, and wanted something between those extremes at a time when MRP servers were rare. Thus, we try to maintain a fun, easygoing, beginner-friendly atmosphere that encourages roleplay. Originally beginning as a /tg/station fork, Urist moved to Baystation's codebase in 2014, and has since developed a number of its own features, including multiple unique maps, FTL-inspired ship-to-ship combat, new gamemodes, and much more.
