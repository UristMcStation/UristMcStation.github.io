<head><title>Server Rules</title></head>
<body>There's a lot here, but the gist of the rules is roleplay takes priority. Don't metagame. Don't play to win. Don't be a jerk OOCly. If you don't understand what those words mean or you need more detail, read on!
	<br />If you aren't aware of our rules, you could be warned by
an admin or jobbanned! Poor conduct as a member of the
security force/a head/a silicon will not be tolerated. These roles will be treated more harshly should rules be broken.</b>
<p>Keep IC in IC chat and OOC in OOC chat.  Please don't discuss ongoing rounds in OOC or you will be muted.</p>
<p>No killing, except in self defense, or as an antagonist (and show restraint even then).  Sitting around watching isn't fun.</p>
<p>If you have a problem or a question, <b>adminhelp it!</b> You can do so through the adminhelp button or by pressing F1. 
We exist for a reason, and would like to keep the server fun. We can't predict everything, and questions are likely to crop up during play, especially with regard to antagonists. Asking won't hurt anyone.</p>
<p>Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have done unto you.  Try to keep things enjoyable for everyone.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Primary Policies</h2>
	<br />
		<ol>
		<dt>0. Admins may disregard any of these rules at their discretion when they feel its in the best interest of the current round/server/playerbase at large. They will, of course, be fully accountable for their actions should they choose to exercise this privilege. In the case of an incident, report it to the Head Admin.</dt>
		<br>
		<dt>1.We're all here to have a good time. If you're intentionally trying to ruin everyone else's good time, you won't have a place here. Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome at all. </dt>
		<br>
		<dt>2. You are playing a game where you are not fully in control of everything. You will be put into situations beyond your control, which will result in some rounds being ruined for you. Hopefully this doesn't happen often, but it does happen, so you will have to deal with it. However, if you are obviously griefed, be sure to report it to administrators by using the "adminhelp" verb. </dt>
		<br>
		<dt>3. This is a roleplaying game. The purpose of the game is to have fun roleplaying. Being an asshole, who ruins other player's roleplay experience, just to win, is considered a "play-to-win" style of playing. You can and will be banned for this playstyle. Be considerate of other players' experience.</dt>
			<dd>3a. Urist McStation is a medium roleplay server. This means that you are expected to roleplay a relatively sane character, try to be grounded and realistic where possible. However, we're not going to get mad at you for doing stuff outside your job that your character might not realistically know, especially on low-pop rounds.
			<dd>3b. Randomly murdering people is generally considered to be ruining someone's fun and poor form in roleplay. If you don't have a solid IC reason for murder, you may be removed. Trying to justify it with "My character is so random/insane" is not tolerated.</dd>
		<br><br>
		<dt>4. IC information should be kept out of OOC channels and vice-versa. Use LOOC for OOC stuff that relates to the people near you IC, and AOOC for OOC planning with other antags.</dt>
		<br>
		<dt>5. Don't metagame. Do not ever use information, acquired out of character or through patterns or events your character would not be able to know, in game. This rule largely exists to make antagonists more interesting. The average person may not know what a changeling is or what they can do, but if you see them absorbing someone, you're going to understand that they're bad news.</dt>
			<dd>5a. This game is developed by volunteers in their spare time. Do not expect perfection. If you find a bug or an exploit, report it via adminhelp or on the discord. Abusing bugs or exploits is not allowed. This includes reacting to events or patterns, which your character would not be able to identify IC (metagaming). </dd>
		<br><br>
		<dt>6. If you take up or are given a job, which is important for game progression (head of staff, AI, antagonist role), make sure you actually do that job. If you find yourself unable to do this due to real life circumstances, just let an admin know (adminhelp) before you leave, please. </dt>
		<br>
		<dt>7. Speak like a normal person while in character. Don't spam, either IC or OOC. Don't use smileys, netspeak, etc. in IC speech. You can emote in character by using the "me" command or specific emote commands, so do that instead of smileys.</dt>
		<br>
		<dt>8. ERP (Erotic Roleplaying) is disallowed on Urist McStation.  It's nearly impossible to ensure that people who don't wish to hear it don't have to listen (bystanders, ghosts, admins). There are other servers for that.</dt>
		<br>
		<dt>9. Ingame administration has the final say in all ingame matters. If problems arise, you can report offending or abusive admins on the forum thread, or more preferably in a private message to one or more admins. If an admin says something was valid, it means it was valid. This is the admin's way of saying it' been investigated and found to not breaking any rules; The admin will not reveal ingame information. </dt>
		<br>
		<dt>10. Hate speech or racial slurs (this includes, but is not limited to the n-word or f*ggot) are not allowed and will get you kicked or banned. Hate speech is not protected speech in my country, so I don't give a shit if you whine about free speech, there is zero tolerance on this.</dt>
		<br>
		<dt>11. It should go without saying, but if you break the rules (or regularly come very close to breaking them i.e. "toeing the line"), you will be warned, muted, banned, or talked about rudely. </dt>
		<br>
		<dt>12. Be excellent to eachother. </dt>
	</ol>

	<h2>Additional Policies</h2>
	
<h3><u>Roleplay</u></h3>
    Murder is justifiable as long as it was properly escalated. You can't go from a single rude punch to a knife in the neck. You can, however, go from a single punch to a counter punch to a brawl to using weapons, and so on. Other IC justifications may exist for murder, but these are on a case by case basis. Minor aggravations like demotions, pranks, insults, or thefts are not adequate justification.
    IC in OOC can be a no warning ban of 15 minutes, it can be longer if the IC in OOC is severe. To clarify, this is revealing anything about the current round that others can use in the OOC channel. If you are unsure do not say it.
    Avoid using non character names. If you have a very offensive name or an obviously immersion breaking moniker like 'xenohunter360' you will be asked to change it or it will be changed for you.
    As long as there is adequate IC backing and it doesn't happen too often, assisting a traitor is well within the rules.
    Admins are not only allowed to run events or otherwise influence the course of rounds, they are encouraged to. They are as much GMs as they are enforcers of the rules, perhaps even moreso.
    Persistent character relationships are acceptable, so long as they're roleplayed out consistently. Wordlessly assisting your OOC friends (or harming your OOC foes) ICly is NOT cool and will be addressed harshly. Roleplaying out your interactions will help you stay on the right side of the rules. How much or how little of previous "shifts" your character recalls is up to their discretion, with the caveat that being a known traitor doesn't persist past the round it occurred in.
    Griefing on the shuttle can also be a no warning ban scaling up from 15 minutes. Shuttle griefing is attacking people or preventing people boarding before the shuttle has launched for no IC reason.
	General shittery is disallowed as non-antags. Welding/bolting airlocks for no reason, setting off lube/acid/mindbreaker smoke bombs in crowded rooms, using lube randomly, breaking windows to space, destroying the bots, handing out disabilities disguised as superpowers or clean SEs, releasing a horde of slimes intentionally, becoming a slime and going on a rampage, intentionally releasing harmful viruses, unconsented borging/medical procedures, blowing borgs for no reason, the list goes on and on. When in doubt, refer back to the golden rule, and don't be a dick.
	<br />
	
<h3><u>Silicons</u></h3>
    All Silicons are expected to follow their laws to the best of their ability. Failure to do so will likely result in a job ban from all silicon positions.
    AI laws are all followed equally unless otherwise stated in the laws themselves, a la Asimov's laws. The exception to this are hacked, ion, and zeroth laws such as 0. This is a law or $^@%. These are followed in order, but have higher priority than numbered laws. 
    Asimov silicons are not required to do what players who threaten self-harm demand, unless they choose to interpret law 1 to include that. 
	<br />
	
<h3><u>Command/Security</u></h3>
    Security are expected to use non-lethal force when defending against non-lethal attacks. This of course also means that security are allowed the option to use lethal force when defending against lethal attacks. Getting stunned in a dark maintenance hallway by an assistant is potentially lethal - a clown slipping you outside Medbay, probably not.
    Permabrigging is functionally the same as murder. Anyone who is valid for execution is valid for permabrigging. Anyone who is not justifiably executable is, likewise, not justifiably a candidate for permabrigging. Makeshift permabrigs are treated the same as the official permabrig in terms of rules-enforcement.
    A Captain or acting Captain may execute criminals, traitors, and other known threats to the station should alternatives not prove sufficient. Abuse or misuse of this privilege can lead to job banning or worse.
    Theft, assault, annoyance, false arrest, sentence times etc. are in character matters. Unless it is extremely excessive or griefy, it is not an admin matter. 
	<br />

<h3><u>Antagonists</u></h3>
	Murderboning is not allowed, not even as an antag. Killing everyone on station is not acceptable, or fun, especially with no roleplaying. Expect an antag ban at the very least. There's a lot more that you can do as an antag besides killing, and as an antag, your 'job' is to make the round interesting and have fun. As such, you have no set objectives, but you can adminhelp and ask for some, or set your own. Obviously you are allowed to kill as an antagonist, but try to dream up something more interesting than releasing the singularity or blowing up the supermatter.
	<br />
	
<h3><u>Species</u></h3>
	Just as you are expected to play an actual character, you are expected to play a character that aligns with your chosen species. We don't have many hard rules for playing as other species, besides <b>No violence as Dionae, whatsoever.</b> This includes nymphs. Breaking this rule will get you banned from Dionae/nymphs.
	
<h3><u>Admin-help</u></h3>
    When you adminhelp do not say things like 'is it valid?' or 'being griefed', give details of what is happening and ideally who is doing it, job and character name.
    If you see someone doing something that seems out of line adminhelp right then, do not wait until round end to see if they are a traitor then adminhelp next round. It makes it a lot harder to deal with.
    Do not lie in PM's and avoid being aggressive, unhelpful or insulting to admins, lying while being questioned over an incident will cause you to receive a longer ban and being consistently insulting or aggressive will get you muted. <br><br>
    Any private communication between a player and an admin regarding a complaint, problem, or other issue related to this server should be kept as such, private. Any such communication should not be shared with any party, publicly or privately, excluding other admins, without the permission of the involved admin or the head admin.
